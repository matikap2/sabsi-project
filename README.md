# sabsi-project

This repository contains implementation of two Neural Networks, one based on assignments from Stanford CS231n course and second based on Tensorflow framework.

To run just execute:
```sh
pip3 install requirements.txt               # Install dependencies
python3 NewerNeuralNetwork.py               # Two-layer neural network based on CS231n and display results.
python3 TensorflowNeuralNetwork.py          # Two-layer neural network based on Tensorflow framework
tensorboard --logdir logs-tensorflow/fit    # To display results of TensorflowNeuralNetwork.py using tensorboard
```
